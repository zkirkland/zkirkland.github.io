                Yellow and orange flames flickered and consumed the cotton and wood. The fire was growing slowly, leaving nothing but charred wood, ash, and suffocating smoke in its wake. To the right of her burning bed, there was a gaping hole in the wall where her
                dresser used to be. The dresser was now on the floor, in splinters. The once pristine clothes it held were scattered everywhere, imprinted with large muddy paw prints. The rest of the room was in similar disarray. A lone figure in the
                middle of the room sighed. The figure was a short but strong man with dark curly hair and a large bushy mustache. He wore blue worker overalls with a red t-shirt underneath. He took off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair. He
                stared at the bed and watched the flames slowly eat away the feathers of what once was her pillow. He could still make out a slight indentation of where she lay her head when she slept. The figure lowered his eyes and focused on the paw
                prints at the base of the bed. His eyes followed the path of the paw prints back to the hole in the wall. He glared at the hole as if it was the cause of all of his troubles. Behind him, through the bedroom door, he heard the screams of
                the many servants and workers frantically trying to put out fires elsewhere in the castle. The figure sighed, depressed. He had been through this before. He knew exactly who had taken her.

                "Here we go again." He said aloud, as if anyone outside the room would hear him or even care. He took a deep breath and steadied himself. It was as if he inhaled strength out of thin air. He carefully placed his hat back on his head. The large "M" on
                the front barely visible in the fire light. Finally, with a last deep breath, he turned and walked out the door from which he entered.

                As he walked away a small shrill voice called after him, "Mario! Good luck!" but it was too late. Mario was already gone.
